 HTML & CSS Foundations Card

This project showcases a simple card layout designed with HTML and CSS. The card includes an illustration, a button, publication date,
title, description, and author information. The layout is inspired by a reference picture provided in the repository.

Features

- Card Layout: A structured card that displays an illustration, a button, publication details, a title, a brief description, and author information.
- Responsive Design: The card is centered horizontally on the page and adjusts its width and layout based on the viewport size.
- Styling: Utilizes various CSS properties such as background colors, borders, padding, margins, box-shadow, and font styling to enhance visual appeal.

HTML Structure

The HTML file (`index.html`) consists of the following sections:

1. DOCTYPE Declaration and HTML Head:
    - Specifies the HTML5 document type.
    - Sets the character encoding to UTF-8.
    - Defines the viewport settings for responsiveness.
    - Includes internal CSS styling within a `<style>` tag.

2. Body:
    - A `div` with the class `card` that represents the main content of the card.
        - A `div` with the class `picture` containing an image (`illustration-article.svg`).
        - A `div` with the class `button` displaying the text "Learning".
        - A `div` with the class `publish` showing the publication date.
        - A heading (`<h2>`) with the title "HTML & CSS Foundations".
        - A paragraph describing the importance of HTML and CSS.
        - A `div` with the class `logo` containing an author's profile picture and name.

CSS Styling

The CSS styles define the appearance of the card and its elements:

- Body: Sets the background color, font, and dimensions of the body.
- Card: Applies background color, padding, borders, margin, width, and box-shadow to the card.
- Heading and Paragraphs: Styles the text color, font weight, and alignment.
- Button: Styles the button with background color, font properties, padding, border-radius, and cursor.
- Image: Ensures the image is responsive and centered within its container.
- Logo: Aligns the profile picture and author's name horizontally.
